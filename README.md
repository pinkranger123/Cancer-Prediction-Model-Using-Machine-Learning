# Cancer-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning
Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python script for predicting cancer types based on a given dataset using machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pinkranger123/Cancer-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning.git

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Cancer-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning

2. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python Cancer_Prediction_Model_Using_Machine_Learning.py

Output : 
The script will print the accuracy scores of SVM, Random Forest, and Neural Network models. The best-performing model will be saved as best_model.pkl.

Notes : 
The dataset is loaded from data_train.csv file.
The models are evaluated based on accuracy.
The best-performing model is saved for future use.
